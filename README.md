# Temperature-Prediction-Time-Series
In this project, I create a short-term temperature forecast.
Get and clean temperature data from www.ecad.eu
Build a baseline model modelling trend and seasonality
Plot and inspect the different components of a time series
Model time dependence of the remainder using an AR model
Compare the statistical output of different AR models
Test the remainder for stationarity
